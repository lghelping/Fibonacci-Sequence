# Fibonacci-Sequence
This assignment was assigned for COP2805C (CRN 24106)at Valencia College.
Project created By Luis Gonzalez

The Purpose of this Project/Homework is to create 2 different classes by expanding then Thread class incorporating both approaches using the Fibonacci sequence. The threads will incorporate each mechanism/class to define the value of 'n' before the run of the function
 initiate the algorithm's execution and measure the time required for computation. Ultimately, the thread will exhibit the calculated solution on the screen, accompanied by the corresponding duration in milliseconds.

 Please refer to the Solution.docx for the answer for this assignment.
